  <h1> Abstract </h1>
  <p>Scroll & Compare is an interactive game where your choices affect the outcome of the story. It is based on the idea that through social media people suffer through comparison. Although most of the things we run into in social media are mostly fake, dramatized, or exaggerated, we tend to compare ourselves to others all the time, making us feel less than or left behind. My Twine game that I provided above tackles those issues in a meaningful way while leaving the player with some insight and research facts about the harm of comparison through social media. One of my favorite quotes from this assignment, and in general goes, “Comparison is the thief of joy.” This was a fun project to work on, I hope you enjoy it! </p>
